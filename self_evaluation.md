# Answers
1. I feel confident with the content on Arrays so far, but I'm frustrated that shift and unshift don't seem like analogous methods.
1. Before moving to the next lesson I'll spend some time skimming the Ruby docs on arrays in order to at least introduce myself to some more methods I may come across in the next couple days.
1. Can an element in an array be an array itself? For example, I have 2 cats, 2 dogs, and a turtle. Could I make `cats = ["Juniper", "Tonic"]`, `dogs = ["Butler", "Porter"]`, and `turtles = ["Jericho"]` and then make `pets = [cats, dogs, turtles]`?
